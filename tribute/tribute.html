          I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all the frontliners
          who faced life and death situations every now and then. I thank you
          for your hard-work and perseverance to continue fighting against the
          spreading virus. Your selfless service to the world is helping us all
          get through this crisis. Words are not enough to thank you for your
          strength, courage, and dedication to give service to those in need. I
          know that being on the frontline isn't an easy job, but all of us
          appreciate it and all of you deserve our applause, our thanks, and our
          respect. All of us are deeply grateful for the sacrifices that you
          have been making throughout this pandemic.
