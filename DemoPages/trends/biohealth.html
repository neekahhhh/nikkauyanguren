            <h2>Dialysis Machine</h2>
            <h4>Creator: Willem Johan Kolff</h4>
            <h3>The hemodialysis machine uses a pump to slowly take blood out of your body and put it via a dialyzer. It functions similarly to a kidney, filtering excess salt, waste, and fluid. Through the second needle in your arm, the cleansed blood is reintroduced into your body. This is used for patients who have kidney failures.</h3>

            <h2>CT (Computerized Tomography) Scan</h2>
            <h4>Creator: Godfrey Hounsfield</h4>
            <h3>A scan that combines a sequence of X-ray pictures taken from various angles around your body with computer processing to produce cross-sectional images (slices) of the bones, blood arteries, and soft tissues within your body. CT scan pictures include more information than standard X-rays.</h3>

            <h2>X-ray</h2>
            <h4>Creator: Wilhelm Roentgen</h4>
            <h3>Is a machine that is used to obtain images of dense tissues such as bones and teeth because X-rays are extremely penetrating, ionizing radiation. This is due to the fact that bones absorb more radiation than less dense soft tissue. X-rays from a source are projected onto a photographic cassette after passing through the body.</h3>
